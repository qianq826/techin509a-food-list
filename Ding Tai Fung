Din Tai Fung was originally founded as a cooking oil retail business in 1958 in Taipei, Taiwan, by Yang Bingyi and his wife, Lai Penmei. The transition into a restaurant business started when the retail market began to decline, and they shifted towards selling steamed buns (xiaolongbao) and noodles to keep the business afloat.

Din Tai Fungâ€™s xiaolongbao quickly became popular due to their delicate skin and rich flavors, turning the restaurant into a beloved place for dining. Over the years, the restaurant gained significant recognition and even received a Michelin star at various locations. Din Tai Fung has since expanded globally, with numerous outlets in countries around the world, such as the United States, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and many more.

Their menu has also evolved over time to include a variety of dumplings, noodles, soups, and other traditional Chinese dishes, allowing diners to experience a broad spectrum of flavors and textures. The meticulous preparation and consistent quality of their dishes have continued to captivate food lovers globally, establishing Din Tai Fung as a cherished brand in the culinary world.
